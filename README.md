# Build_different_models_on_SMILES_data
The dataset consists of SMILES and its activity values. here I will take this as a regression task. Here I have solved this task using three approach. 
The first approach I have calculated the fingerprints, hyperparameter tuning was done and build several models.
The second approach I have build using the sequential model and descriptors remains the same i.e, fingerprints.
The third approach is an advanced architecture where I have used pytorch and used the BertTokenizer for SMILES and build the model.(This is just for experiment purpose)
